A responsive and visually accurate clone of the Netflix user interface, built exclusively with HTML and CSS. This project demonstrates a strong understanding of modern CSS layout techniques, including Flexbox and responsive design.

## Features
* **Pixel-Perfect Design:** A faithful recreation of the Netflix UI's layout, spacing, and visual style.
* **Pure CSS Implementation:** The entire layout and styling are achieved without a single line of JavaScript, showcasing the power and flexibility of CSS.
* **Fully Responsive:** The UI adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Dynamic Flexbox Layouts:** Extensive use of CSS Flexbox for efficient and scalable content alignment and distribution.
* **Interactive Hover Effects:** Smooth transitions and scaling effects on movie cards to enhance user experience.
* **Custom Styled Scrollbars:** The horizontal scrollbars for the content rows are styled to match the dark theme, ensuring a cohesive design.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the UI.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and responsiveness.

## Project Structure
* `index.html`: Contains the core structure of the Netflix UI, including the header, navigation, and all content rows.
* `style.css`: The stylesheet responsible for all visual aspects, including colors, fonts, layout, and responsiveness.

## How it Works
The project leverages two core CSS concepts to achieve its design:

### 1. Flexbox
The entire layout is structured using Flexbox. This allows for:
* Effortless horizontal alignment of navigation items.
* Dynamic distribution of space within content rows.
* Consistent alignment of elements within individual movie cards.

### 2. Media Queries
CSS media queries are used to create a truly responsive experience. The layout adjusts based on the viewport size:
* On smaller screens, the movie rows may switch to a vertical grid.
* Font sizes and spacing are scaled down to prevent content from overlapping.
* The number of movies visible per row changes to fit the available screen width.

## Installation & Usage
To run this project locally, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
